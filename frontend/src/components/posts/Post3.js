                    1. The Beginnings: Classic Console Adventures
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    The earliest Harry Potter games introduced fans to Hogwarts
                    through console gaming, starting with titles like{" "}
                    <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</i> on
                    PlayStation and Game Boy. These games were linear,
                    story-driven experiences where players could relive key
                    scenes from the books and movies, often using simple
                    spell-casting mechanics and platforming elements.
                  </p>{" "}
                  <p>
                    These early console games, despite their limitations,
                    provided fans with an unprecedented chance to step into
                    Harry’s shoes, casting spells, flying broomsticks, and
                    facing magical creatures. For many fans, these were the
                    first moments they truly felt part of the Wizarding World.

                  <h2 className="section-heading">
                    2. Expanding the World: Open-World and RPG Experiences
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    As gaming technology improved, so did the scale of Harry
                    Potter games. Titles like{" "}
                    <i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i> and{" "}
                    <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> introduced
                    more open-world elements, allowing players to freely explore
                    Hogwarts and interact with its magical environments.
                  </p>{" "}
                  <p>
                    These games offered a more immersive experience, letting
                    fans discover hidden areas of the castle, interact with
                    familiar characters, and complete side quests. This shift
                    reflected a growing desire for RPG (Role-Playing Game)
                    elements in Harry Potter games, where players could forge
                    their own path and feel more connected to the Wizarding
                    World.

                    The advent of mobile gaming opened new possibilities for
                    Harry Potter games. Games like{" "}
                    <i>Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery</i> and{" "}
                    <i>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</i> introduced unique
                    gameplay mechanics tailored to smartphones, allowing fans to
                    play on the go.
                  </p>{" "}
                  <p>
                    <i>Hogwarts Mystery</i> brought fans a story-based
                    experience, where they could create their own student,
                    choose a house, and make decisions that affected their
                    character’s journey. <i>Wizards Unite</i>, on the other
                    hand, used augmented reality (AR) technology to bring
                    magical creatures and artifacts into the real world,
                    creating an immersive, location-based game similar to{" "}

                  <p>
                    These mobile games made the Wizarding World more accessible,
                    allowing fans to experience magic anytime, anywhere. This
                    shift highlighted the potential for immersive Harry Potter
                    games that didn’t rely on traditional consoles or PCs.

                    As technology continues to advance, Harry Potter games are
                    poised to embrace even more innovative platforms, like
                    virtual reality (VR). With VR, players could fully immerse
                    themselves in the Wizarding World, experiencing Hogwarts,
                    Diagon Alley, and even dueling in real-time, as though they
                    were truly there.

                    Though there haven’t been many official VR Harry Potter
                    titles yet, fan interest in VR experiences remains high. VR
                    could transform how fans interact with the Wizarding World,
                    making spells, magical creatures, and iconic locations feel

                  <p>
                    Over the years, Harry Potter games have had to adapt not
                    just to new technology, but also to changing fan
                    expectations. Modern fans want more than just a story-driven
                    experience; they want depth, customization, and the freedom
                    to create their own journey within the Wizarding World.
                    Games like <i>Hogwarts Legacy</i> reflect this evolution,
                    offering fans a sprawling RPG experience where they can
                    craft their own magical story.

                    making impactful choices. By evolving with fans, Harry
                    Potter games remain relevant and beloved by new generations.

                    The evolution of Harry Potter games mirrors the growth of
                    the Wizarding World itself—from a single book series to a
