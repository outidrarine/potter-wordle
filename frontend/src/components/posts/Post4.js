                  <p>
                    One of Harry’s favorite spells, *Expelliarmus* is used to
                    disarm opponents by knocking their wands (or weapons) out of
                    their hands. In Harry Potter games, this spell is essential
                    for duels, especially when facing powerful foes who rely
                    heavily on their wands. *Expelliarmus* helps players defend
                    themselves and gain a strategic advantage, giving them a
                    chance to counterattack.

                    symbols, and explore dimly lit areas in dungeons or caves.
                    It’s a subtle spell, but one that brings a sense of
                    discovery and adventure to the gameplay.

                    In duels and battles, *Stupefy* is invaluable for stunning
                    enemies, rendering them momentarily immobile. This spell
